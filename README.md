# cypher
cypher++ is a windows encryption tool used to do simple encryption/decryption

enigma: will shift key by one each character when enabled
decrypt: will decrypt, enigma and key must be the same as it was when the message was encrypted
encrypt: will encrypt a message
close: will close the program

simply unzip the .zip file and run the program!

by the way, the c++ input command will cut off after a "whitespace", so dont use spaces!
(hopefully will be patched soon)
